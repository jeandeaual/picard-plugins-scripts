This repository hosts plugins for [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/).

## Development Notes

Use `install.py` to install the plugins on MusicBrainz Picard.

The script `generate.py` will generate a file called `plugins.json`, which contains metadata about all the plugins in this repository.
